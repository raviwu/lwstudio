As a team player, I encouraged trust and glued the team. I shared and learned with the team, excelling technology excellence and open to adopt new practices.

Bridging the gaps with more than ten years experiences in different business roles, I obtained entrepreneurship, communicated and integrated among the deliveries, company strategies, and customer values.

I am a technically confident engineer, I enjoy challenging problem solving and deepen my engineering capabilities. I am passionate to Agile and Scrum, I believe in customer value and people connection, and I deliver.
